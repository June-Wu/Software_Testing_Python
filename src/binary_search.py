def binary_search():
    '''
      Usage: The function applies the generic binary search algorithm to search if the value
      x exists in the list, and returns a list contains: TRUE/FAlSE depends on whether the x value has been found,
      x value, and x position indice in list

      Argument:

           x: numeric
           list: sorted list of numerics

      Return:

           a list contains:
            - first element is a logical value (TRUE/FALSE)
            - second element is a numeric value of x
            - third element is a numeric in range of 0 to length(list) where 0 indicates the element is not in the list

      Examples:

      binary_search(4, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
      >>> [TRUE,4,4]

      binary_search(5, [10,100,1000,1000])
      >>> [FALSE,5,0]

    '''
    pass
